# PoRC: Perioperative Risk Calculator

## Background

This is a fork of an app I wrote that was badged as ‘the NELA app’ which, usefully for clinicians, had laparotomy risk calculators.

It was MIT licensed and developed pro bono.

The NELA leadership within the RCoA has chosen to have their app development continued by a third party developer, however there is no release date yet available.

Accordingly, this app has been released to ‘fill the gap’ and to provide clinicians with a portable and offline means to undertake clinical risk prediction.

It has all the NELA-owned assets that are not MIT licensed stripped out for IP purposes and has been rewritten (from ionic v1 to v3) to take advantage of performance increases and newer mobile devices.

## Compiled versions

These are available for iOS and Android at the Apple and Google Play stores:
